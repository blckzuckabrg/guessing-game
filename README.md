The Guessing Game

This is a guessing game developed based on a system of questions revolving
around my favorite NBA player Lebron James.  The game consists of a series of
questions(7) that which, depending on your answer, shows you if you have guessed correctly
of incorrectly.

In addition to the game question responses, there's also a bit of animation.  So
depending on the user response, displays a "Thumbs Up" if the answer is correct,
and displays a "Thumbs Down" if the answer is incorrect.

At the start of the game, the time and date is displayed onto the page showing
when the user visits the page.

Hopefully, The Guessing Game creates some fun activity and user
engagement!
